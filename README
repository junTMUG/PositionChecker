This program is for PCB CAD EAGLE and Silhouette Cameo.
Use this one to write DXF file composed of holes and outlines on a PCB board.
Cut some paper and place parts on it. This can help checking placements and 
physical interferences of parts on the board.

Optionally you can print patterns on the board and cut them.
